# Personal website
 _What is your website about? is it directed to a particular field or industry?_
 
  My website is about my portfolio and my coding works that I have already done as well as my hobbies and interests.
  
 _Audience. Who are your visitors and what information will they be looking for?_
 
  My audience are potential artists who want to collaborate or potential companies that would be interested in working with me
    
_What existing websites perform a similar function?_

  My first inspiration was this [website](https://930296.cargo.site/). I was browsing the internet for some inspiration and I really liked this website as it represents the desktop of the computer. I found it interesting for the folders to represent my projects that I had already done. The main page has a navigation bar made with _bootstrap_, folders and social media links. 
There are currently 3 folders and about_me page:
- The forest scene website is made with _parallax effect_ and is about my processing project
- The surale folder is about a project I made in p5js last year
- The sudoku folder is about my Pygame sudoku for 2 game
- About me page was made using _Vanilla JavaScript_ with added packages (e.g. draggable)

These are my first **sketches**:

My intial [idea](https://rp.mockplus.com/rps/5iye-H1B1/E4k-K317OX?) of the folder layout. Each folder represents my project.

After creating low-fidelity prototype, I started implementing my ideas. 

  My idea for the about_me page was first inspired by this [project](https://codepen.io/kseniacold/pen/QKNKow). Then, I decided to extend my moodboard by explaining about my favorite things. 

  Right now, I added my projects from last year but I am willing to add more project as I am studying.
