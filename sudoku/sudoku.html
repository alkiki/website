          The idea behind the game was to create a sudoku grid that 2 players
          can solve at the same time. The rules are pretty simple: before the
          game starts, players can choose the level of the initial sudoku
          grid. When the game starts, each player has a 1-minute limit to fill
          in the grid. If the value is correct, then it stays on the grid and
          the score of the players goes high by 1. If the value is incorrect,
          the grid does not change, and the player’s score goes down. The game
          ends when the grid is completed. The player that has the highest
          score, wins. This game was written in Python.
