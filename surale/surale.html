        Both of my parents are from Tatarstan, a small republic in Russia, and
        ever since I was a child I would spend all of my school summer holidays
        there. My grandmother has taught me tatar language by reading me
        traditional tatar folklore. I was raised on these stories and would like
        to share my heritage and culture with the rest of the world. The idea
        behind this project was to create an interactive story about Şüräle, a
        forest spirit. This project was created in p5js, using illustrations
        created by Baynazar Almenov.
